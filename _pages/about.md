Hi! My name is Lucas Almeida Rocha, and I'm a Master's student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I study material mechanics. In my free time, I like programming (among other things, of course), so I've "created"[^1] this blog to share some projects that I can't explain in just one readme page on Github.
